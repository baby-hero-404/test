## Overview

This project provides a standardized workspace designed to run and verify code-generation tasks, automated planning, and system-level refactoring. It is specifically tailored for Go-based algorithmic implementations, centering around a root-level solution package with auxiliary utility sub-packages.

## Project Structure

```text
.
├── solution.go      # Core algorithmic solution
├── solution_test.go # Solution unit tests
├── go.mod           # Go module specification
└── readme.md        # Project documentation (this file)
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go Compiler**: Version 1.18 or higher is recommended.

### Setup

Clone the repository and inspect the tasks:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd test
```

## Development Workflow

This repository is optimized for rapid prototyping and verification of Go algorithmic solutions.

### Writing Code

- Keep core logic self-contained within `solution.go`.
- Add comprehensive unit tests in `solution_test.go` covering edge cases.
- Maintain consistent Go styling by running `go fmt` before submitting changes.

### Code Quality Guidelines

- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize inputs in solution entries.
- **Performance**: Optimize time and space complexity for algorithmic solutions.
- **Clean Code**: Follow Go idioms, keeping logic simple, readable, and well-documented.

## Testing

To run the automated tests within this workspace, use the following commands:

```bash
# Execute the Go test suite
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...
```
